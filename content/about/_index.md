# About Me

I am James Willson, a fifth year Computer Science PhD candidate at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tandy Warnow](https://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/). Previously, I received a BS degree in Computer Science with a second major in Mathematics from [University of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu/).

I have published [research](/publications) covering topics in computational biology and network science. This research has focused on both developing novel algorithmic methods with good empirical performance, as well as theoretical guarantees.

Currently, I am interested in the problem of creating scalable methods for level-1 phylogenetic network estimation.

### Research/Technical Experience

I have worked on species tree estimation under models containing both gene duplication and loss as well as incomplete lineage sorting. This resulted in three publications as first author, the most significant being the introduction of the DISCO software (published in Systematic Biology). I worked on theoretical research in network science resulting in a paper published in PLOS Complex Systems. This work showed that there was no impossibility result for Kleinberg’s clustering axioms in the context of graph clustering algorithms. Additionally, the paper had results regarding the “resolution limit,” a significant problem in community detection. I am currently working on developing fast and accurate algorithms for estimating phylogenetic networks. Skills I have acquired include writing and maintaining software actively used by researchers, experience planning and executing studies for measuring the empirical performance of software, and theoretical research and writing formal proofs. Relevant courses at UIUC I have taken include four graduate courses in computational biology, Computation Scientometrics, and Algorithms.

### Personal Statement

I completed my undergraduate degree at University of Memphis in Computer Science and a second major in Mathematics. I am currently a fifth year (I started Fall 2020) Phd student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researching computational biology and network science. My research has focused on both developing methods with good empirical performance as well as theoretical guarantees. At UIUC I have developed skills in software development, planning and executing empirical studies for evaluating methods, as well as more theoretical work, including writing formal proofs and further developing my mathematical intuition. This coming summer I am looking for opportunities to both develop those strengths further, as well as, apply my current experience to new problems that I might not have considered. I also feel that there is an opportunity to broaden my experience, since much of my research so far has been done for a single lab.  My long term goal is to have a career as a researcher, either in academia, in a national lab, or in industry.

### Experiences

- Worked on species tree estimation under models containing both gene duplication and loss as well as incomplete lineage sorting. This resulted in three publications as first author, the most significant being the introduction of the DISCO software (published in Systematic Biology).
- I worked on theoretical research in network science resulting in a paper published in PLOS Complex Systems. This work showed that there was no impossibility result for Kleinberg’s clustering axioms in the context of graph clustering algorithms. Additionally, the paper had results regarding the “resolution limit,” a significant problem in community detection.
- Currently working on developing fast and accurate algorithms for estimating phylogenetic networks. Specifically, a method that given a constraint tree and a set of quartets can estimate the optimal placement of edges into that network to maximize the number of induced quartets in polynomial time.

Decomposition Into Single-COpy gene trees (DISCO) is a method for decomposing multi-copy gene-family trees while attempting to preserve orthologs and discard paralogs. These single-copy gene trees can be subsequently used by methods that can estimate species trees from single-copy gene trees such as [ASTRAL](https://github.com/chaoszhang/ASTER) or [ASTRID](https://github.com/pranjalv123/ASTRID) in order to obtain an accurate estimation of the species tree. Additionally, DISCO can be paired with concatenation analysis with methods such as [RAxML](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng).

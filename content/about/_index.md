# About Me

I am James Willson, a fifth year Computer Science PhD candidate at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tandy Warnow](https://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/). Previously, I received a BS degree in Computer Science with a second major in Mathematics from [University of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu/), where I did research under [Prof. Thomas Watson](https://www.cs.memphis.edu/~twwtson1/).

I have published [research](/publications) covering topics in computational biology and network science. This research has focused on both developing novel algorithmic methods with good empirical performance, as well as theoretical guarantees.

Currently, I am interested in the problem of creating scalable methods for level-1 phylogenetic network estimation.
